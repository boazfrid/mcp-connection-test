# Golang Performance Optimization

## Profiling
- Use `go tool pprof` for performance analysis
- Profile CPU, memory, and goroutine usage
- Use benchmarks to measure performance

## Memory Management
- Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths
- Reuse slices and maps when possible
- Use object pools for expensive objects

## Optimization Techniques
- Use string.Builder for string concatenation
- Prefer slices over arrays for flexibility
- Use interfaces wisely - they have overhead

## Benchmarking
```go
func BenchmarkFunction(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        FunctionToTest()
    }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls
- Premature optimization
- Not measuring before optimizing
- Micro-optimizations at expense of readability
- Ignoring garbage collection impact
